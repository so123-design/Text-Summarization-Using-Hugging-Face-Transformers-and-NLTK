# Text-Summarization-Using-Hugging-Face-Transformers-and-NLTK
This project demonstrates a Python-based text summarization tool leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. It combines the power of Hugging Face's Transformer library with NLTK for tokenization to create a robust abstractive summarization pipeline. This tool takes a large body of text as input and generates a concise summary, making it ideal for summarizing articles, reports, or any text-intensive documents.
